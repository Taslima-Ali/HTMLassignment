    <p>Unchallenged as my favourite genre, a great fiction novel never fails to encapture me into the fun, exciting and sometimes scary world of my favourite characters.</p>
    <p>As a teenager, I am very glad to say that I was unable to avoid the fantasy phenomenon <a href="harrypotter.html"><i>Harry Potter</i></a> and, as a result, I think it is fair to say I am very much a Potterhead! </p> 
    <p>As much as I have grown to love the world of Harry Potter, my first fictional obsession was infact <i>The Huger Games</i>. </p>
